Something I've been wanting to do for a while is start a blog and actually document things that I'm doing related mainly with InfoSec.
As of right now most of my documentation is all in OneNote and I feel like putting it out on a blog will force me to be more organized
and even help reinforce my learning and push myself even further. 

I managed to finish OSCP and CISSP this year, so it has been an extremely busy year. I hope to have a lot more coming in 2018 related to InfoSec and
any other IT ventures. Thanks for reading!
